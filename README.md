# Curriculum-Based Ensembling for Sentiment Classification

This project was done as part of the [Computational Intelligence Lab](http://da.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/2022/CIL/) at ETH Zurich. The goal was to predict the sentiments of tweets classified as either positive or negative. We managed to score a classification accuracy of `91.54%`, which placed us fourth out of 25 teams on the [Kaggle competition leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cil-text-classification-2022/leaderboard).
